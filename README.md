## Overview

"My Data Scientist" is a Python application designed to assist data analysts and scientists in making informed decisions using existing data. The app integrates functionalities for data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, statistical analysis, machine learning, and visualization, making it a comprehensive tool for data analysis.

## Features

### Core Features

- **Data Loading**:

  - Load data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Cleaning**:

  - Remove duplicate rows.
  - Handle missing values by either removing them or filling them with specified values or the mean.
- **Data Preprocessing**:

  - Convert date columns to datetime format.
  - Forward-fill missing values in the dataset.
- **Data Splitting**:

  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets based on a specified target column.


### Data Wrangling

- Perform data cleaning to ensure data integrity and quality.

### Statistical Analysis

- Provide a statistical summary of numerical columns, including mean, median, mode, range, sample size, standard deviation, and confidence intervals.
- Conduct normality tests on specified columns.

### Machine Learning

- Train a simple linear regression model using numeric columns as features and a user-defined target column.
- Evaluate the model's performance using RÂ² score.

### Visualization Options

1. **Distribution Plot**:

   - Visualize the distribution of a specified numeric column.
2. **Bar Chart**:

   - Create a bar chart for categorical data.
3. **Box Plot**:

   - Visualize the distribution of a numerical column grouped by a categorical column.
4. **Scatter Plot**:

   - Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two numeric columns.
5. **Scatter Plot with Linear Regression**:

   - Generate a scatter plot that includes a linear regression line.
6. **Histogram**:

   - Display a histogram for the distribution of a specified numeric column.
7. **Pie Chart**:

   - Create a pie chart for a specified categorical column.

### User Interaction

- **Command-Line Interface**:

  - Allow users to input choices for visualization types and target columns interactively.
- **Logging**:

  - Provide logging for successful operations, warnings, and errors for better debugging and user awareness.

### Error Handling

- Handle various errors, such as:
  - File not found.
  - Empty datasets.
  - Invalid column names for visualizations.

### Default Settings

- Load a default dataset if no file path is provided.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Willie-Conway/My-Data-Scientist.git
   cd "My Data Scientist"
   ```


## Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Place your CSV file in the  `data/`  directory.
2. Run the app:

```bash
python my_data_scientist.py
```

3. Follow the prompts to load data, preprocess, split, and  visualize.


### Running the App with a Specific File

To run the app with a specific CSV file, you can specify the file path in the command line when you execute the script. For example:

```
python my_data_scientist.py --data data/your_specific_file.csv

```

## Testing

To run the tests, use:

```
python -m unittest discover -s tests

```

## Sample Unit Tests

You can create a `tests/test_my_data_scientist.py` file with the following content:

```
import unittest
import pandas as pd
from my_data_scientist import MyDataScientist

class TestMyDataScientist(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.app = MyDataScientist()
        self.app.load_data('data/test_data_with_duplicates.csv')  # Ensure you have the sample data available

    def test_load_data(self):
        self.assertIsNotNone(self.app.data)
        self.assertTrue(isinstance(self.app.data, pd.DataFrame))

    def test_preprocess_data(self):
        self.app.preprocess_data()
        self.assertFalse(self.app.data.isnull().values.any())

    def test_clean_data(self):
        original_shape = self.app.data.shape
        self.app.clean_data()
        self.assertLess(self.app.data.shape[0], original_shape[0])  # Expecting some rows to be removed

    def test_train_model(self):
        # Assuming 'Weekly_Sales' is the target column in your sample data
        target_column = 'Weekly_Sales'
        self.app.clean_data()
        self.app.preprocess_data()
        self.app.machine_learning(target_column)

    def test_visualization(self):
        # Assuming you have a column 'Store' to visualize
        column_to_visualize = 'Store'
        chart_type = '1'  # Histogram
        self.app.visualize_data(column_to_visualize, chart_type)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


```

## Example Dataset

The app includes a sample  dataset located as `data/sample_data.csv` for testing.

### Running the App

1. **Install Requirements**:
   Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Navigate to your project directory and run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   2. **Run the App**: Execute the app by running:
